## Introduction

This calculator allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The project consolidates knowledge of JavaScript functions, DOM manipulation, and event handling.

## Project Requirements

The calculator must include the following features:
1. **Basic Math Operations:** Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division.
2. **Operate Function:** A function that takes an operator and two numbers, then returns the result of applying the operator.
3. **User Interface:** Buttons for each digit and operation, a display for showing the result.
4. **Clear Functionality:** A button to reset the display and stored values.
5. **Handle Multiple Calculations:** The calculator should handle one operation at a time, and use the result of the previous calculation as the first number for the next calculation.
6. **Error Handling:** Display an error message for invalid operations (e.g., division by zero).
7. **Round Long Decimals:** Ensure that long decimal numbers are rounded to prevent overflow on the display.

## Features

- **Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division:** Perform these basic arithmetic operations with ease.
- **Clear Functionality:** Reset the calculator at any time.
- **Chained Calculations:** Continue calculations using the result of the previous operation.
- **Error Messages:** Snarky error messages for invalid inputs or operations.
- **Decimal Support:** Handle floating-point numbers accurately.

## Usage

To use the calculator:
1. Enter the first number by clicking the digit buttons.
2. Select an operator (e.g., `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`).
3. Enter the second number.
4. Press the `=` button to calculate the result.
5. Use the `C` button to clear the display and start a new calculation.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML:** Structure the calculator's user interface.
- **CSS:** Style the calculator to make it visually appealing.
- **JavaScript:** Implement the calculator's functionality and interactivity.

## Challenges and Learnings

During this project, I encountered several challenges, including:
- **Managing Multiple Operations:** Ensuring that the calculator only performs one operation at a time and correctly uses the result for subsequent calculations.
- **Error Handling:** Implementing logic to handle edge cases, such as division by zero.
- **UI Design:** Creating a user-friendly interface that reflects the calculations accurately.

These challenges provided valuable learning opportunities in problem-solving and JavaScript debugging.

## Future Improvements
- **Decimal Input:** Users can input decimal numbers and perform calculations with floating-point precision.
- **Backspace Button:** Allows users to delete the last entered digit.
- **Keyboard Support:** Users can interact with the calculator using their keyboard for an enhanced user experience.
- **Enhance Design:** Further improve the user interface to make it more responsive and visually appealing.
- **Memory Functions:** Implement memory buttons (M+, M-, MR) to store and recall values.
- **Scientific Functions:** Add advanced operations like square roots, exponents, and trigonometric functions.

## Conclusion

This project was a comprehensive exercise in applying JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to build a functional and interactive web application. The experience has solidified my understanding of JavaScript fundamentals and DOM manipulation.
